Explore caves in Minecraft like never before.


## What is this?
**YUNG's Better Caves** is a mod that completely overhauls vanilla Minecraft's cave generation. Better Caves adds never-before-seen types of caves and caverns for you to explore.

Experience winding, turbulent caves and vast, lava-filled caverns!

## Extreme Flexibility
Better Caves includes an extensive user configuration, allowing players to cater cave generation to their liking. You can easily change the size, shape, and frequency of different cave and cavern types.

These settings can be found in the Mods option in Minecraft's main menu screen.
